# Lyft-Trip-Data

Practicing what I learned about joins by combining rows from different tables. This is one of the projects that I worked on from the Codecademy course.

~ Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

  trips: trips information
  riders: user data
  cars: autonomous cars
